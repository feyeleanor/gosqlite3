== About ==

GoSQLite3 provides both low-level and high-level wrappers for accessing the SQLite3 database from Go.
It started as simple extension of the API defined by Russ Cox in his wrapper which has since been
extended with a number of high-level conveniences.


== Installation ==

We support goinstall which can be invoked using the following command-line:

	goinstall -dashboard=true github.com/kuroneko/gosqlite3


== Usage ==

Please read the tests for examples of how to perform queries and handle results.
Documentation will follow in due course.
